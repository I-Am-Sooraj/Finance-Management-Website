Finance Management Website was my engineering sem3 mini project for Mumbai University.It's a basic website where currently user can only calculate loan emi.The main aim to upload the source code of this website was to get the students a rough idea how the template of a finance management site should look like.

On this website user can currently calculate their Loan Emi using the loan emi calculator tool which can be accessed by pressing the calculate button which is situated in right corner of the page/website.Also i have used to hyperlinks so that user can be redirected to some other websites where they can learn more about finance management.

Languages used for making the site are html,javascript,css. For The GUI/styling of the website we have mainly used Tailwind CSS.As Tailwind CSS makes it quicker to write and maintain the code of the website/application.

1.index.html-This file contains the source code(src) for the home page.
